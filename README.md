### General description

JSDroid can automatically detect JavaScript-related vulnerabilities in large-scale Android apps. The input of JSDroid is a deal of Android APK files. The tool is used to detect whether these Android apps contain any of the three JavaScript-related vulnerabilities. Accordingly, the output of JSDroid is a vulnerability detection report. In the folder "Samples", we also provide some APK files of Android apps to use/test our tool.
